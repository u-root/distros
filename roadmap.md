# Roadmap

Initial build incorporating u-root

## Next steps are by hand the first time

successfully download an iso

mount it and extract the kernel

kexec it just to see how kexec works

preserve the iso across the reboot so the kernel can see and use it

full boot

## now we write the program to do the stuff we did by hand

Write the extra commands needed to implement webboot functionality

Boot into webboot image

## stretch goals

add signing support

add wifi
